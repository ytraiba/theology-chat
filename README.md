# Chat With A Religious Expert - AI-Powered Chat Bot

The goal of this project was to create a chatbot that could answer any of my spiritual or religous questions. The chatbot provides a conversational response as well as the source of its information from either the Bible or the Quran.

I accomplished this by embedding both the Bible and the Quran into a Pinecone vector database to be used as context. I engineered a custom prompt and then fed both the prompt and the context to OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate the responses. This website uses Next.js, LangChain (Typescript), OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Tailwind CSS.
